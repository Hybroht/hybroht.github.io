    <h2>User-Agent String</h2>
    <pre><code>HybrohtResearcher/1.0 (+https://hybroht.com/research-automation; contact@hybroht.com)</code></pre>

    <br>

    <h2>Purpose and Goals</h2>
    <p><b>HybrohtResearcher</b> is a cluster of different tools designed for research purposes.
    <br> Its main goal is to automate the discovery of relevant content for our projects.
    <br> Secondary objectives include connecting our utilities with other platforms, such as providing thumbnail previews or enabling indexing of websites in our internal search engine.</p>
 
    <br>

    <p>We may access your platforms to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Analyze content for relevance within specific fields (e.g., academic trends).</li>
    <li>Generate thumbnail previews or one-sentence calls for pages on your website. (e.g., Bluesky posts).</li>
    <li>Monitoring tasks, checking your platform's availability, mostly on behalf of our partners.</li>
    <li>Index your website in a search engine.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <p>We do not:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Harvest your website's data to sell it.</li>
    <li>Collect website data to train generative models.</li>
    <li>Ignore robots.txt directives when they are applicable.
    <li>Ignore opt-out requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h2>Security Measures</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Static IP addresses associated with <a href="hybroht.com">hybroht.com</a> subdomains.</li>
        <li>Operation schedule, rate limiting, and related measures to prevent excessive access (e.g., a high number of requests per second). </li>
        <li>Programming methods combined with LLM-based interpretation of robots.txt for dynamic compliance.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h2>Capabilities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Allowlists and blocklists to honor opt-out requests and avoid undesired content in our research.</li>
        <li>Fetching website content preferably via official APIs or RSS feeds. HybrohtResearcher can perform GET requests on pre-specified web links for content analysis but will not follow new links that appear in a response.</li>
        <li>Our tools check a platform's robots.txt file before fetching any content. We use a combination of parsing techniques and large language model (LLM) tools to ensure full compliance, even if your robots.txt is poorly formatted or contains extra specifications.</li>
        <li>Re-checks the robots.txt file for updates every 3 days.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>As a cluster of tools, it does not track whether it has accessed your website earlier the same day during other tasks. Therefore, it may access the same URL again in a different task.</li>
        <li>Our tools respect restrictions: if they are blocked by your platform, they will move on and will not attempt to circumvent the block.</li>
        <li>The tools do not verify robots.txt when calling methods that only fetch metadata about a resource, such as HTTP HEAD requests.</li>
        <li>As of this date, the information provided on this page is available only in English.</li>

    </ul>

    <br>

    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    <p>The tools operate using workflow orchestration in a Linux environment. They interact with target systems primarily through APIs and RSS feeds.</p>

    <h3>Data Sources</h3>
    <p>The tools primarily collect data from knowledge bases and news platforms. Occasionally, they may also gather relevant public social media posts for ongoing research. Collected data is restricted to news-related content suitable for our research projects, such as breaking news. Our tools do not directly collect or focus on personal user data.</p>

    <h3>Operation Schedule</h3>
    <p>The tools operate on a daily schedule, preferably during regular business hours, but they may also run outside these times.</p>

    <br>

    <h2>Access and Usage Policies</h2>
    <p>HybrohtResearcher is programmed to honor robots.txt directives, even if the file is incorrectly formatted or contains unsupported rules. The preferred methods for fetching content are through APIs or RSS feeds; however, HTTP GET requests to website URLs may occur for certain tasks. <br> If content retrieval fails after one attempt, our tools will not retry to conserve resources and respect your site preferences. Opt-out requests from website owners will be fully respected without requiring a reason.</p>

    <h3>Privacy and Compliance</h3>
    <p>No part of HybrohtResearcher is designed to actively collect personal user data. Any incidental data of this kind is neither targeted nor retained; it is promptly discarded or anonymized to mitigate security and legal risks. <br> While our separate business partnerships may require handling their sensitive data, such projects are not directly involved in our own research process.</p>

    <h3>Opt-Out Mechanism</h3>
    <div class="opt-out">
        <p>If you wish to opt out of being researched by this system, please email us at <a href="mailto:contact@hybroht.com">contact@hybroht.com</a> with your request.
        <br>Include <b>"[Opt-Out]"</b> at the beginning of the subject line and add your website in the email body.
        <br>Optionally, you may also provide a reason.
        <br>
        <br>
        Please note: although providing a motive is optional, any eventual opt-back will not be allowed without a reason. For operational safety, entries in our domain blocklists will not be removed if their registry lacks a motive.</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <h2>Troubleshooting and Support</h2>
    <p>For any issues or concerns related to HybrohtResearcher (not including the opt-out mechanism described above), please contact us through one of our channels at <a href="https://hybroht.com/contact">https://hybroht.com/contact</a>.</p>
