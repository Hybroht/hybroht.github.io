      <h2>Vision, Policies, and Ethical Standards</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>Constitution Summation</h3>
      <p>At Hybroht, our constitution defines who we are and what drives us. We are a research-focused company committed to advancing science, technology, philosophy, logic, and mathematics. Our dual mission guides everything we do: generating sustainable profit to fund ongoing research, while aiming to deliver products and services that push beyond current limits.</p>
      <p>Our values emphasize ethics, transparency, and encouraging intellectual impact. Hybroht fully complies with laws and holds every associate to a strict code of conduct centered on confidentiality, honesty, and respect. We set short-term and long-term goals to keep us on track. </p>
      <h3>Business Policies: Key Principles and Provisions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Assign clear responsibility roles for licensing, R&D, compliance, and support functions.</li>
        <li>Respect intellectual property and protect confidential info from unauthorized disclosure.</li>
        <li>Enforce documented, approved licenses with regular evaluations and strict adherence.</li>
        <li>Compliant research and high-quality development.</li>
        <li>Ensure full legal and regulatory compliance.</li>
        <li>Apply to all operations and staff involved.</li>
        <li>Maintain data security.</li>
        <li>Uphold ethics, promoting integrity and respect.</li>
        <li>Review and update policies annually, incorporating feedback.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Corporate Structure</h3>
      <p>Adequate to our small size, all current members hold the position of Executive Consultants, distinct from their specific operational roles. Members collaborate closely, but final business decisions rest with the Founder, who is accessible to ensure bureaucracy does not get in the way.</p>
      <h3>Ethical Standards</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Act with integrity in all interactions.</li>
        <li>Respect the rights and dignity of all individuals.</li>
        <li>Protect confidentiality and respect proprietary information.</li>
        <li>Comply fully with all laws, regulations, and policies.</li>
        <li>Ensure fair and ethical dealings with clients, partners, and associates.</li>
        <li>Foster a culture of accountability and trust.</li>
      </ul>
       <h3>Founder Commitment</h3>
       <p>Hybroht is not meant to be an AI startup. This enterprise is a long-term vision of the founder beyond the tool named Artificial Intelligence.</p>
       <p>While fully embracing technological innovations, it is my belief and focus that the true power rests within the drive to research and development. New tools can enhance us and bring us closer to our objectives, but they cannot replace ourselves. With that said, one should be careful to not mistake the work for the dream.</p>
       <p>My aspiration is to seek new knowledge, for as long as I live. With Hybroht, we will go forth now and seek it.</p>

    <section id="accountability-reporting" class="integrity-overview">
      <h2>Accountability & Reporting</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>Served Countries and Regions</h3>
      <p>Our products and services are designed for remote delivery, allowing us to serve multiple countries and regions. As of this page’s writing, most of our operations (sales of products and services) are concentrated in two countries: the United States, and Brazil. In line with our business ethics, we respect the laws of our clients' countries and regions. We uphold their rights when providing our offerings.</p>
      <h3>Registry of Integrity Breaches</h3>
      <p> As of the update date, we do not hold any record of integrity breaches within our operations. If you wish to report misconduct by one of our associates, please contact us via our contact email.</p>
      <p><b>The Founder will personally ensure that such reports are addressed and appropriate action is taken, prioritizing handling of issues upon contact.</b></p>

    <section id="partners" class="integrity-overview">
      <h2>Partnerships: Process and Statistics</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>Due Diligence Procedures</h3>
      <p>
        Prior to establishing partnerships of any nature, we conduct a thorough examination to ensure alignment with ethical standards, legal requirements, and our strategic objectives. This process includes verifying the partner’s legal status, reputation, and current operations. We periodically review any potential risks to maintain transparency and accountability throughout the partnership lifecycle.
      </p>
      <h3>Partnership Types</h3>
      <p>Partnerships are entities, companies or individuals, divided into two types: Supporters and Affiliates.</p>
      <p>Supporters assist our research and development through activities like testing new products and providing feedback. They also offer counsel on current and future projects. In return, they receive early access. <i>Customers who purchase our products and services are not included in these statistics.</i></p>
      <p>Affiliates are partners contributing directly to our growth through granting us additional resources or receiving our services as part of a deeper, joint venture.</p>
      <h3>Partnership Statistics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>3</b> SUPPORTERS</li>
        <li><b>2</b> AFFILIATES</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p class="small-observation"><i>*By default, we do not disclose partner names unless they expressly request it or authorize us.</i></p>
      <br>
    </section>

    <section id="excluded-entities" class="integrity-overview">
      <h2>Insights on Excluded Entities</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>Methodology</h3>
      <p>To safeguard our current and future operational effectiveness, we employ both a proactive and reactive approach to vetting entities unsuitable for any form of relationship with our enterprise. This evaluation applies to all clients, supporting platforms, channels, or partners. Upholding our values as the guiding principles of our operations, we keep this record to enforce a persistent refusal to collaborate, directly or indirectly, with the excluded entities for the foreseeable future.</p>
      <p>Paths for remediation or review, depending on the reason(s), include contacting us to explain a possible misunderstanding, changing the current course of action, or issuing an apology statement.</p>
      <h3>Reasons for Exclusion</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Engaging in Fraudulent Actions</li>
        <li>Unfair Treatment</li>
        <li>Lack of Transparency</li>
        <li>Violation of Service Agreements</li>
        <li>Breach of Privacy / Data Security</li>
        <li>Ethical Concerns</li>
        <li>Noncompliance with Company or Regulatory Policies</li>
        <li>Poor Customer Support</li>
        <li>Leadership Association</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small-observation"><i>*This list is not exhaustive but provides a general overview of typical exclusion reasons.</i></p>
      <h3>Statistics of Excluded Entities</h3>
      <p>Despite the small stature of our initiative, we have unfortunately already encountered altercations with entities deemed ineligible for future interactions, motivating the creation of this section. In addition, we take a proactive stance to future-proof ourselves by including entities in this list even if they have never directly engaged with us before.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 Platform</li>
        <li>2 Companies</li>
        <li>2 Individuals</li>
      </ul>
