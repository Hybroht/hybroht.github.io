HYBROHT FAIR DUALITY LICENSE
Copyright © 2025 HYBROHT

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of
this Software to use, copy, modify, and distribute it under the following terms:


INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

  The Creator retains all rights to the original Software, including patents. 
Modified versions must provide proper attribution to the Creator upon request.  
The Creator’s trademarks are not licensed; use of names or logos requires
explicit permission.  

  Users may not falsely claim endorsement or affiliation by the Creator.  
Patent litigation primarily aimed at financial gain terminates the User’s
rights immediately. Defensive patent claims and collective defense against
patent assertion entities are permitted.  

  Manufacturers or distributors may not sue Users who lawfully install modified
versions for non-commercial, non-competitive purposes.  

  The Creator may request a license for commercial offerings using this Software,
free for their non-profit use or at a 50% discount for their commercial use,
within one year of first distribution. The Creator will not use such offerings
to produce competing offerings. If Users create offerings competing with the
Creator's offerings using this Software, the Creator reserves the right to
incorporate modifications or improvements from such competing offerings into its
own offering.


RIGHTS AND REQUIREMENTS

  This license is granted only as part of a dual-license pairing with a
recognized FOSS license approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). Users may
choose either this license or the accompanying FOSS license, not both
simultaneously.

  The rights granted are non-exclusive. No discrimination against any person or
group is permitted.

  Paid redistribution of the original Software is prohibited; free
redistribution, source access, modification, and derivative works with proper
attribution are allowed.

  Redistributions, including modified versions, must provide access to the
complete corresponding source code under the same license terms. This also
applies to software used to provide services over a network.

  Commercial use of the Software is permitted under the fair terms of this
license.

  Contributors may be compensated according to separate agreements with
transparent governance, such as Contributor License Agreements (CLAs), which
govern compensation, governance participation, and related rights. Transparency
means contributors with such agreements have access to licensing decisions,
product roadmaps, and commercial income use. Compensation processes require
public governance records with a 7–14 day comment period or longer and a
published payment policy with payments either publicly posted or auditable.
Optionally, at the contributor's discretion, these processes may be managed by a
neutral steward with the contributor's signed consent.

  Vendor lock-in is forbidden. Digital Rights Management (DRM) is prohibited
except solely to protect research and educational works conducted for
non-profit purposes.

  If the Software is no longer maintained, Users are encouraged to share
information supporting its continued use; this is a plea, not a requirement.

  Users must honor licenses of third-party dependencies.


LICENSE MANAGEMENT

  This license requires that any modified versions or derivative works must be
released under the same license, unless prior negotiation and explicit
permission are obtained from the Creator.

  Compliance with applicable laws and emergency exceptions is required.

  License amendments must be published separately, clearly highlighted,
non-contradictory, and easily accessible.

  Sublicensing is forbidden. 

  License transfers are permitted only if made without coercion or improper
influence. Verification requires a signed, dated statement from the transferor
and proof that the full written offer was delivered at least 15 days before
signing. The transferee or designated steward shall accept these as sufficient
unless a dispute arises, in which case preserved communications may be reviewed.

  This license is perpetual but terminable upon breach after notice. Users retain
rights to copies lawfully acquired before termination.  

  The Creator may exclusively relicense the original Software under a different
license, including Free Software licenses, only within one year from the date of
first distribution, by issuing a separate, publicly accessible amendment
alongside that distribution. This relicensing option does not extend to modified
versions or derivative works.


EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN A SEPARATE WRITTEN WARRANTY ADDENDUM OR
AGREEMENT, THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE
CREATOR OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIMS, DAMAGES, OR
OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EXCEPT
TO THE EXTENT COVERED BY SUCH ADDENDUM OR AGREEMENT.
