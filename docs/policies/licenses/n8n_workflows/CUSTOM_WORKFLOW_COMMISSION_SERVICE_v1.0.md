### ⚖️ Custom Workflow Commission Service License v1.0  
*License version date: 2025-07-29*

**Summary:**  
By commissioning or purchasing a custom automation workflow built with n8n and AI agents ("the Service"), you agree to these terms.  
The commissioned workflow is provided "as is," with no warranties and limited support primarily restricted to delivery and initial use assistance. You may receive answers to your questions regarding starting and using the workflow. However, upgrades, maintenance, or further enhancements beyond initial delivery are outside the scope and require separate commissions or negotiation.  
This Service is licensed for your personal, internal, and commercial use as part of your own products, services, or workflows. You may share the workflow **within** your organization but sharing, redistributing, or sublicensing with unaffiliated third parties is strictly prohibited.  
**Resale, sublicensing, or redistribution of the commissioned workflow or substantial workflow outputs as standalone software or in bundles for third-party sale is strictly prohibited.**  
We expressly reserve the right to sell the same commissioned workflow (or variants thereof) to other clients, possibly at prices different from what you paid, without liability or obligation to you except for avoiding usage tied to your brand and rights. **Exclusivity rights are not included in these commissions and may only be granted through explicit negotiation and separate agreement. Exclusivity requests are outside the scope of this standard commission service and require direct contact and negotiation.**
Refunds are granted in accordance with the Refund Policy below. Unexpected delays, interruptions, or external service failures are not the responsibility of the service provider.

*This summary is for convenience only. The full terms below govern your use of the Service.*

  By commissioning, purchasing, or accepting delivery of the workflow, you confirm you have read, understood, and accepted these terms.  
- **Version Updates and New Commissions:**  
  This license is version 1.0 or later as determined by the service provider at their sole discretion. The service provider may release future license versions; you may accept such updated terms, which will govern workflows delivered under those versions.  
  Unless otherwise specified, **all new commissions will be licensed under the latest license version at the time of commissioning.** Continued use of workflows licensed under prior versions is governed by those respective versions unless explicitly re-licensed.

#### 2. Intended and Permitted Use

- **Use Rights:**  
   You are granted a non-exclusive license to use and modify the commissioned workflow for *any* personal, internal, or commercial purpose, including embedding or integrating it into your own products, services, or systems (such as within a larger software product or other workflows).
