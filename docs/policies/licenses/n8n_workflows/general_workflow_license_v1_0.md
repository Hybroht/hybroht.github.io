# ⚖️ Hybroht's General Workflow License v1.0  
*License version date: 2025-09-01*

**Summary:**  
By purchasing, commissioning, or using this workflow, you agree to these terms. The workflow is provided "as is," without warranties and with support generally limited to delivery and initial use assistance. Upgrades, maintenance, or further enhancements beyond initial delivery require separate agreements.

This workflow is licensed for personal, internal, and commercial use as part of your own products, services, or automation pipelines. You may share the deliverables **within** your organization, but sharing, redistributing, sublicensing, or reselling the workflow or substantial outputs to unaffiliated third parties or for commercial distribution is strictly prohibited.

We reserve the right to sell the same or similar workflows or services to other clients at different prices without liability to you, except for avoiding usage tied to your brand and any confidential customizations. **Exclusivity rights are not included and must be negotiated separately and explicitly.**

Refunds are only considered in rare, good-faith cases. Delays or interruptions, especially due to factors beyond the creator’s control, are not our liability. If a dispute arises, both parties agree to first attempt resolution in good faith.
