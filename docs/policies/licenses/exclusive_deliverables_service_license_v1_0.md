# ⚖️ Hybroht's Exclusive Deliverables Service License v1.0  
*License version date: 2025-08-12*  

**Summary:**  
By commissioning or purchasing one of our services under this exclusive deliverables license, you agree to these terms. The Service is provided "as is," without warranties and with support primarily limited to delivery and initial use assistance. You may receive answers to questions regarding starting and using the deliverables, but upgrades, maintenance, or further enhancements beyond initial delivery require separate agreements.  

This license grants you exclusive rights to the commissioned deliverables for your personal, internal, and commercial use as part of your own products, services, or workflows. You may share the deliverables **within** your organization, but sharing, redistributing, or sublicensing with unaffiliated third parties is strictly prohibited. **Resale, sublicensing, or redistribution of the commissioned deliverables or substantial outputs as standalone software or in bundles for third-party sale is strictly prohibited.**  

We grant you exclusivity specifically for the commissioned deliverables under this agreement. The service provider reserves the right to continue providing the same or similar services to other clients, but will not provide your commissioned deliverables to others without your consent.  

Refunds are granted in accordance with the **Refund Policy** below. Unexpected delays, interruptions, or external service failures are not the responsibility of the service provider.  

*This summary is for convenience only. The full terms below govern your use of the Service.*
