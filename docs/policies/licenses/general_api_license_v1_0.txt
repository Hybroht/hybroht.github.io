HYBROHT'S GENERAL API LICENSE v1.0
Copyright © 2025 HYBROHT

This License governs your right to use the Hybroht API and related Affiliate
Partner APIs solely for authorized system integration purposes. It grants
limited, non-transferable access to Hybroht’s API and Affiliate APIs for system
integration, allowing commercial use only under separate agreements. It ensures
data from Hybroht-controlled sources is accurate while disclaiming external
data, and requires Licensee-provided data to be valid. It forbids unauthorized
modifications, redistribution, and assigns liability for misuse to Licensee.
Dependencies on third parties may change without liability to Hybroht.
Compliance with laws and attribution to Hybroht is required. Updates and
upgrades to the API are provided without direct support obligations. Licensee
must provision the necessary infrastructure for their systems. This license
requires that the parties first mutually accept on a jurisdiction for dispute
resolution within 90 days; if no agreement is reached, disputes will be governed
and resolved under the jurisdiction of Singapore.


*The above summary is for convenience only. The full terms below govern your use
of the API.*  


I. LICENSE SCOPE AND USAGE RIGHTS

  Hybroht ("Licensor") hereby grants you ("Licensee") a limited, non-exclusive,
non-transferable, and non-sublicensable license to access and use a Hybroht API,
which may connect either solely to Hybroht’s systems or to Hybroht’s systems
alongside those of its Affiliate Partners (e.g., Dr. Infinitto). Licensee
accepts this License by using the API. Hybroht may update the API or this
License’s terms; continued use signifies acceptance of such updates.

  Licensee shall only use the API to the extent necessary to fulfill authorized
system integration objectives. Commercial use of the API is permitted only
pursuant to a separate, explicit agreement with Hybroht and its Affiliate
Partners. Any use beyond this scope is prohibited unless expressly authorized in
writing, including: reselling, redistribution, sublicensing, or granting
third-party access.

  Hybroht reserves the right to enforce call rate limits, feature availability,
data volume quotas, or other usage constraints to maintain service stability.
Licensee agrees to comply with such restrictions. Hybroht may modify these
limits with reasonable prior notice.


II. DATA, COMPLIANCE, AND LEGAL RESPONSIBILITIES

  Hybroht commits to providing API data that is accurate and reliable to the 
best of its reasonable ability, including any data originating from
Hybroht-controlled systems. Data sourced from external third-party APIs or
Affiliates is provided “as is.” Licensee is responsible for ensuring the
accuracy of any data they submit or provide to Hybroht through the API.
Submission of invalid or false data by Licensee may result in suspension or
revocation of access rights.

  Licensee shall not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, sublicense, 
modify, redistribute, or create derivative works from the API. Licensee assumes
all responsibility for compliance with applicable laws and regulations and any 
misuse of the API.

  API functionality may depend on third-party or Affiliate Partner technologies
which may change or be discontinued without notice. Hybroht disclaims liability
for any such external changes or failures. Licensee agrees to indemnify Hybroht
against any claims arising from Licensee’s misuse or breaches of this License.

  Licensee shall comply with all applicable laws, including privacy, data
protection, and export control requirements. Appropriate attribution to Hybroht
and its Affiliates is required unless otherwise agreed.

  Hybroht shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance caused by
circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to
natural disasters, cyberattacks, acts of governmental authority, or labor
disputes.


III. MAINTENANCE, SUPPORT, AND UPDATES

  Hybroht will provide API updates and upgrades at its sole discretion. However,
Hybroht is under no obligation to provide direct technical support for the
Licensee’s implementation or use of the API in their internal systems. Licensee
is solely responsible for provisioning and maintaining any necessary agents or
systems required to implement API usage. Hybroht will provide technical
documentation and may answer non-binding questions but reserves the right to
suspend updates or support services at any time.


IV. CONTRACTUAL AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

  This License represents the entire agreement between Licensor and Licensee
governing use of the API. Any amendments must be in writing and signed by both
parties. Both parties agree to cooperate to select a mutually agreeable
jurisdiction to resolve any disputes; in absence of such agreement under 90
days, the governing law shall default to that of Singapore. Termination occurs
upon material breach after notice or mutual agreement. Upon termination,
Licensee shall cease all API use and destroy related materials.


V. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OWNERSHIP

  Hybroht retains all intellectual property rights in the API. For specific APIs
co-developed or belonging jointly to Hybroht and an Affiliate Partner (e.g., Dr.
Infinitto), intellectual property rights shall be held jointly by the respective
parties. No ownership rights are transferred under this License.
